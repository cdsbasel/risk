## Process

In the group hackathon (13:00-18:00), we will be using data visualization **to understand how people perceive all sorts of technological and societal risks**, from nuclear energy to climate change! Participants will work in small groups of three to five people to produce stunning data visualizations using information on risk perception related to numerous risk sources.

## Data

We will use data from an ongoing project by [Zak Hussain](https://psychologie.unibas.ch/en/persons/zakir-hussain/about-me/), [Dirk Wulff](https://dwulff.github.io/about/), and [Rui Mata](https://matarui.org) that will be made publicly available shortly before the hackathon.
