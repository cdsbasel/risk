This is the home of the **CDS Risk Hackathon** which took place on **November 16th, 2022**.

The **Center for Cognitive and Decision Sciences (CDS)** coordinates collaborative projects involving students and researchers from the Faculty of Psychology as part of its mission to provide training in data analytics (see [www.cds.unibas.ch](https://psychologie.unibas.ch/de/fakultaet/abteilungen/cognitive-and-decision-sciences-305/) for more information).

The hackathon featured a **group [hackathon](hackathon.html) in the afternoon**, as well as a **[training class](training.html) in the morning**. In the hackathon, participants worked in small groups of four to five people to produce stunning data visualizations using information on **risk perception** related to numerous risk sources. Participants were able to get practical knowledge of wrangling data and of designing attractive data visualizations in R. The results of the hackathon can be found in the [report](report.html).
