#### Data and Preprocessing

We will use data from the project **Semantic Accounts of Risk Perception** (Zak Hussain, Doctoral student at CDS).

#### Variables

| Variable | Description |
|:-------------|:-------------------------------------|
| `word` | Around 12K words contained in the intersection of the GloVe and SWOW vocabulary. |
| `cluster` | The group to which each word has been allocated by a clustering algorithm. |
| `in_Fisch` | Boolean indicating whether the word is contained in Fischhoff et al. (1978). |
| `risk_rating` | Mean of participant risk ratings given to each word on a scale of -100 (safe) to +100 (risky) |

**Psychometric Model**
The following are mean responses given on 7-point likert scale to the associated questions:
| `psych_voluntary` | Are individuals exposed to this risk voluntarily or involuntarily? (1=voluntary, 7=involuntary) |
| `psych_fatal` | How fatal are the consequences of this risk? (1=not-fatal, 7=fatal) |
| `psych_immediate` | Is death from this risk immediate or delayed? (1=immediate, 7=delayed) |
| `psych_dread` | Is this a risk that individuals can reason about calmly or is it one that they have great dread for? (1=calm, 7=dread) |
| `psych_catastrophic` | Is this a risk that kills one person at a time (chronic) or a risk that kills large numbers of people at once (catastrophic)? (1=chronic, 7=catastrophic) |
| `psych_controllable` |  Is this risk controllable or uncontrollable for the individual exposed to this risk? (1=controllable, 7=uncontrollable) |
| `psych_known_sci` | Is this risk known or unknown to science,Is this risk known or unknown to the individuals exposed to this risk? (1=Known, 7=Unknown)|
| `psych_known` | Is this risk known or unkown to the individuals exposed to this risk? (1=known, 7=unkown) |
| `psych_new` | Is this risk new or old? (1=new, 7=old) |

*| 'psych_pc[1-9]' | 9 principle components obtained via principle component anlaysis of the above psychometric dimensions |

| `psych_pred_risk` | Predicted riskiness of each word according to 9 psychometric dimensions (see below) |

**Semnantic Models**
The following are predictions from (i) SWOW and (ii) GloVe - semantic (embedding) models respectively trained on (i) free association and (ii) online text data. In addition to predicting the risk ratings, they predict the 9 psychometric dimensions listed above. 
| `[glove/swow]_pred_risk` |
